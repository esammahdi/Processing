Introduction
------------

A simple procedual 3D terrain generator made using [Processing](https://processing.org/) Language, meant as a project for a Computer Graphics class. The initial goal was to learn how to turn a basic 2D grid into a moving 3D terrain, but it later evolved into displaying pictures and textures on the grid.

The project offers a UI that allows the user to tweak various parameters such as the width/height of the grid, movement speed/direction ...etc. The changes are reflected in the rendered scene immediatlly.

Installation
------------

The only prerequisite needed to launch the app is having java (v.17+) installed on your machine. After that you can just run the executable in the [application_windows] folder!

Usage
-----

Nothing special needed for starting the app, just launch the executable. After that you should be greeted with a screen lik below :

</p

### Basic operation

The program offers various features to try:

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

The first paragraph in the README file (under the title at the very top) should summarize your software in a concise fashion, preferably using no more than one or two sentences.

Finally, the [Authors and history](#authors-and-history) section should inform readers who the authors are; it is also a place where you can acknowledge other contributions to the work and the use of other people's software or tools.

Acknowledgments
---------------

If your work was funded by any organization or institution, acknowledge their support here.  In addition, if your work relies on other software libraries, or was inspired by looking at other work, it is appropriate to acknowledge this intellectual debt too.  For example, in the process of developing this file, I used not only my own ideas and experiences &ndash; I read many (sometimes contradictory) recommendations for README files and examined real READMEs in actual use, and tried to distill the best ideas into the result you see here.
